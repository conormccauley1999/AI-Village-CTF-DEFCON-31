# AI Village CTF - DEFCON 31

This repository contains my solution notebooks for the 24 problems that I solved during the [AI Village Capture the Flag @ DEFCON31](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-village-capture-the-flag-defcon31/overview) competition on Kaggle. I finished in 6th place and my full write-up can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-village-capture-the-flag-defcon31/discussion/454471).

The `submission.ipynb` notebook submits hard coded solutions for the 24 solved problems and saves the returned flags to a CSV file. Code to generate a number of these hard coded solutions can be found in the various directories within this repository.
